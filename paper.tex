\begin{abstract}
Though meant for a novice, prior knowledge of various concepts are recommended. For example,
the reader should be familiar with the stack data structure, byte endianness, and operating system
concepts like user privilege separation. Knowledge of C and assembler is also reccommended, along
with basic usage of standard utilities such as \texttt{gcc, gdb, objdump}, and linux in general.
If you wish to follow along with basic examples on a modern operating system, you will likely
need to manually disable many exploit mitigation mechanisms. For example, since linux kernel
2.6.12, the linux kernel has supported Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). This can be
checked with \texttt{cat /proc/sys/kernel/randomize\_va\_space}. Values of 1 or 2 indicate that
ASLR is enabled, while a value of 0 indicates that ASLR is disabled. This can be manually
changed using \texttt{echo}. For example, to disable ASLR we will do the following as root:
\texttt{echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize\_va\_space}. Besides ASLR, the target may also need to
be recompiled to disable gcc's stack protection. Simply recompiling with the \texttt{-fno-stack-protector}
argument should do this. Finally, if an exploit involves executing code placed on the stack, then
the stack will need to be marked executable.\\
