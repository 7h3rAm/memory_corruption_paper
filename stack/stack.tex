\section{Stack}
One of the oldest memory corruption vulnerabilities is the stack-based buffer overflow.
Popularized partly due to Aleph One's paper ``Smashing The Stack For Fun And Profit"\footnote{http://insecure.org/stf/smashstack.html},
this older vulnerability is still a significant issue for application
security. Though modern countermeasures make successful exploitation more difficult, it serves
as both an occasional serious flaw, and an excellent introduction to memory corruption vulnerabilities.
